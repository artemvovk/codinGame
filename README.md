# codinGame
## by Artem Vovk
### The Big Idea
I want to practice solving puzzles and implementing algorithms using different languages.
### Description
- I will be adding the code that I used for codinGame (https://www.codingame.com/games).
- The code is just copied from the in-game IDE
- Languages to use: Bash, Ruby, Java, Python
- Some puzzles will feature solutions using different languages

### Goal
- To complete all Easy+Medium Training puzzles using two languages
- To showcase and store my learning/practicing process

### NAs
- Complete The Bridge using Ruby
- Check out Mars Lander and ASCII art and decide what I will use for those
